## ⚙️Installation

After downloading the template, you have some prerequisites to install. Then you can run it on your localhost. You can view the package.json file to see which scripts are included.

### 🔧Install prerequisites (once for a machine)

* **Node Installation:** [Install node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) [Recommended LTS version]

### 🖥️Local setup

* Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

* Run locally

```
yarn dev
```

After that, it will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to source files, and live-reload the browser when changes are saved.

## 🔨Production Build

After finishing all the customization, you can create a production build by running this command.

```
yarn build
```
